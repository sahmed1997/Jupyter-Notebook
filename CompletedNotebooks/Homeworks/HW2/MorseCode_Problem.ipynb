    "Review [the wikipedia page for Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). Check carefully the rules for how many time units to use for dot, dash, time between them, and time between letters and words. **For this problem, use 0.4 seconds as the time unit.**\n",

    "You will use the red portion of the red-green LED light for the first part of this problem. As a start, have a program that will write out the signal for SOS, the internationally know signal for help, and repeat it over and over again until the user clicks the stop button. (Do this with the red light creating all the dashes and dots.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then switch to the green light and have fun writing out anything you would like. Document in your code what it is writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding guidelines you should follow\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make separate functions to make a dash and a dot with a given color as a parameter to the function\n",
    "- Make individual functions to create each letter or number or character that you decide to include\n",
    "- As with the red-green LED example code provided, make sure your code 'stops' by letting the user interrupt\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do this, the main code for continually sending out SOS would be:\n",
