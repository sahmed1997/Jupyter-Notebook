    "## Required Coing Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "We require these coding conventions because these are norms within the computer science profession.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document the whole program and each function by placing a triple-quoted string at the begging of the code and ahead of each function.\n",
    "    - For runctions, describe what each parameter is and what, if anything, the function returns.\n",
    "    - For whole program, describe what this program does.\n",
    "    - For whole program, include your name and any sources that helped you, including online and people.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Document sections of code when it might not be immediately obvious what they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use descriptive variable names. Obtuse, non-meaningful names are confusing to both you and someone else reading the code at a later date.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use descriptive and accurate function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Break your code into meaningful functions that do one thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make use of a main function or at least an area designated as the main program area. It should be abundantly clear to someone else reading your code where the program starts."

    "## Problem: Wind chill calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "The following information was obtained from [the wikipedia page about wind chill index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_chill).\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard wind chill formula for Canada is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_{\\rm wc} = 13.12 + 0.6215T_{\\rm a} - 11.37V^{+0.16} + 0.3965T_{\\rm a}V^{+0.16}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_{\\rm wc}$ is the wind chill index, based on the Celsius temperature scale, $T_{\\rm a}$ is the air temperature in degrees Celsius (째C), and $V$ is the wind speed at 10 metres (standard anemometer height), in kilometres per hour (km/h)\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard wind chill formula in the U.S. is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_{\\rm wc}=35.74+0.6215 T_{\\rm a}-35.75 V^{+0.16}+0.4275 T_{\\rm a} V^{+0.16}\\,\\!$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_{\\rm wc}$ is the wind chill index, based on the Fahrenheit scale, $T_{\\rm a}$ is the air temperature, measured in 째F, and $V$ is the wind speed, in mph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:**\n",
    "Windchill temperature is defined only for temperatures at or below 10 째C (50 째F) and wind speeds above 4.8 kilometres per hour (3.0 mph). In the functions you will write, you should simply return the given temperature if these conditions are not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your task\n",
    "Write separate functions for calculating the Canadian and U.S. wind chill temperature and returning it, given a temperature and wind speed. Then write a main prgram with a function called `test` that tests out each of your functions for various values of temperatures and wind speeds, including those where the important note above applies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your tests working in the `test` function, then add a separate function called `getData` that first asks the user whether they wish to use Celcius or Fahrenheit to compute a wind chill index. Then ask them to provide the temperature and wind speed. Then report the wind chill temperature to the user with the appropriate degrees (print out whether it is in Celcius or Fahrenheit)."
