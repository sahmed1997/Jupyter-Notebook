Starting on Homework 3, you will lose 10% points on each function you write that does not include this comment (see example in problem 1 below, using 3 doubble quotes). To mark the start of each question, give a hash-mark comment with the problem number and then, on the next line include a summary, descriptive comment using a triple-quoted string. This comment should contain one to two full sentences that describe the script’s purpose: what does the script do. You do not need to include line-by-line comments, please don’t! \n",

    "You are planning to start a non-profit to rescue abandoned guinea pigs. You've rented a building to convert to a guinea pig rescue center. The building has 800 square feet of space in it. You want to know the maximum number of guinea pigs you can house at your rescue center. You are going to plan cages to hold at most two guinea pigs, and you can dedicate no more than 40% of your space to cages (the rest will be for supplies, visitors, and general comfort). A cage for two guinea pigs should be 10.5 square feet at a minimum.  \n",

    "If you stick to the minimum cage size, what is the maximum number of guinea pigs you can house? Report two numbers, the number you can house if you put one guinea pig per cage, and the number if you have  two guinea pigs per cage. Be sure to report the final numbers as integers, since you can't house a fraction of a guinea pig. Round down using the floor function from the math module. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will write a program to do these calculations. You want your program to be general, in case you rent a different building in the future, or you find out that guinea pigs really need more space, or that a different percentage of the space is needed for cages versus other needs. Therefore your program should be as general as possible.\n",

Use different colors and shapes, and make parts of the tree filled in. You can make this simple like a child's drawing, or more complex. You can draw tree in any season, a leafy tree, an evergreen tree, a tropical tree. It’s up to you. The tree should have at least 4 different components, and 3 different colors, but feel free to use as many as you are inspired to do.
