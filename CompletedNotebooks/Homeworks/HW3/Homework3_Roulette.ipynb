    "## Part 1: spin the wheel\n",
    "A spin of the wheel can be simulated by using Python's random number generator library to provide a random number within a particular range. This is demonstrated in the section called [\"Randomly Walking Turtles\" in the Chapter entitled \"More About Iteration\" in your interactive textbook](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/COMP194F16/MoreAboutIteration/RandomlyWalkingTurtles.html). You should import the randRange function at the top of your code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from random import randrange\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then use this function to randomly generate a value between 0 and 37 each time there is a spin (37 can simulate spinning 00).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: determining possible payouts\n",
    "\n",
    "You will implement the following subset of the many different bets that can be placed during a game:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single number (1 to 36, 0, or 00)\n",
    "- Red or Black\n",
    "- Odd or Even (0 and 00 **do not pay out for even**)\n",
    "- Low (1 through 18) or High (19 through 36)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the wheel has been spun, the number will dictate which of these bets might have a payoff. For example, if 24 was the landing slot at the end of the spin, the possible payouts could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pay for a single number bet of 24\n",
    "- pay for black bet\n",
    "- pay for even\n",
    "- pay for high (19 through 36)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write individual functions for each of the different bets. Each function will take a spin value as a parameter and return True if there should be a payout or False otherwise. These functions should be named:\n",
    "\n",
    "    singleNumberPay\n",
    "    blackPay\n",
    "    redpay\n",
    "    oddPay\n",
    "    evenPay\n",
    "    lessThan19Pay\n",
    "    greaterThan18Pay\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing first to ensure correctness\n",
    "Write a test function that tries out each of your functions on all possible values to ensure that the functions are working correctly. You could do this by looping from 0 thtough 37, trying each function and printing what it returns.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Simulate the game using a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to simulate a game play is to use what is sometimes called the *repeat until sentinal* while loop. You keep asking the user for input until they enter a particular value that indicates they want to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you could keep asking the user to place a particular kind of bet, or choose to quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Place a bet:\n",
    "        1. Single Number\n",
    "        2. Red or Black\n",
    "        3. Odd or Even\n",
    "        4. Low or High\n",
    "        5. Quit\n",
    " \n",
    "If they choose 1 through 4, then you continue to ask them for their choice (a number, red or black, odd or even, low or high). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then go on to randomly generate a number and check if their bet was a payoff or not. Report the spin and whether it paid or not. (Note that it will be best to have functions for each of the bets that can be placed and whether they payoff.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat again, asking for a bet or to quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If they chose 5, you would break out of the while loop and quit the game. The choice of 5 is called a sentinal value, because it indicates that the loop will stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outer loop of the game then looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    bet = 0\n",
    "    while (bet != 5):\n",
    "        # hadling of user bet, choice, spin and payoff\n",
    "        \n",
    "    #eventually game stops when user chooses 5\n",
    "    \n",
    "Put this portion of the game itslef in a function called **play()**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then have a main area that calls **play()**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional Challenges\n",
    "Suppose each bet is \\$1. Look up the [payouts for each of these types of bets](http://www.gamblingonline.com/casino/roulette/strategy/payouts/).\n",
    "Add a feature to ask the player for a starting pot of money, or simply assume that the player starts with \\$15. As each bet is placed, compute a payout and report how much money is left in the pot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another addition would be to let the user state how much money they want to bet each time. Then compute the payout based on that bet and determine how much they have left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with adding the dual-color LED light to your code, using separate functions. When there is a winning payout, flash the light green a few times (your choice how many).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option would be to use the small LCD screen attached to the GPIO as an output device that would display a payout win or lose situation."
