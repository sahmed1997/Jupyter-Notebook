    "Looking at the main function, we can deduce not all the functions in the program are being explicity called upon. Insetad, what we believe is happening is that the main function calls setup which has the command \"GPIO.add_event_detect which is an in built function that comes with RPI.GPIO. The add_event_detect command takes four inputs and calls the function, which is mentioned as equal to callback (in this case callback = detect). In this case, detect, then, calls the Led and Print function which are in our code, but not called from the main function.\n"
