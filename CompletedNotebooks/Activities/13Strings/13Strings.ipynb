    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many tools for manipulating strings.  This activity will cover the string methods, as we have already spent some time with operators and functions for strings (e.g., selection, slicing, +, *, len).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea**:  Strings are *immutable*, you cannot modify an existing string, but you can construct a modified copy of the string. Python provides a set of very useful tools for manipulating strings. This activity will explore a few of these tools, including string methods, concatenation and star-repetition, and looping over strings.\n",

    "## String Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Your reading had a partial list of string methods. I recommend looking at [the Python Documentation for String Methods](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str) for the complete list. I've broken down the list of (some) string methods by category below. Define the example strings below, and then try each of the string methods in the examples to see what it does.\n",

    "\n",
    "    for c in s:\n",
    "        #do something with c\n",
    "\n",
    "where s is a string and c is each character of the stringer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try this**: given any input string, write a function called countOnes() that will count how many characters it has that are a '1' (one) and return the count. Write a test function that uses an assert to try it on a string that contains ones and a string that does not."
