    "\n",
    "Today you will learn a bit about Python, and some basic kinds of data Python can manipulate. You'll learn how to store values in variables, and how to build expressions that can be evaluated to produce a value. You will learn how to put sequences of Python statements and expressions in a file, called a script, which can be saved and re-run at a later point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides an interactive shell that we use to communicate with it, much like a calculator provides an interface that we use to communicate with it. With Python, you can type a series of Python statements into the shell, and get immediate responses to each one. You can also package up a series of statements as a script, in a file. When you run the script, Python executes each statement in order.\n",

    "You are reading this inside a web-based tool called Jupyter Notebook, which provides different sections, called cells. Some have formatted text, like this cell you are reading right now. Other cells let you edit and execute Python code scripts, like the one just below this paragraph. A cell that runs code is distingushed by the odd tag to its left with the word In followed by square brackets, [], sometimes with a number in side the brackets, and colon, : .\n"
