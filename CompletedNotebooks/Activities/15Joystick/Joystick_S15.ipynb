    "Look at lines 27 - 29 (escape (Esc), the the L key for line numbers). This is an example of a really long if statement line of code broken into three lines by placing the conditional inside of parentheses, which are typically not needed. Another way of breaking a long line into multiple lines is to end a line that is to be continued on the next line with a \\\\. You could experiment with this if you wish- remove the () and add \\ to the end of lines 27 and 28.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A solution you should not use** is to keep the line really long. The  [Python Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) recommend that no line of code is over 79 characters. 80 characters is a general rule of thumb used for most programming languages.\n",
