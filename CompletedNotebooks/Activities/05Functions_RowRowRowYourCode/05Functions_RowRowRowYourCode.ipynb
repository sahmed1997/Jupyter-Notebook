    "# Row, Row, Row Your Code\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity will practice function decomposition: identifying potential functions, creating functions, removing repetitive code, making code more efficient, and debugging code with functions. You will work in teams of two (three if necessary). Be sure to make a new project for this activity, as you will be making multiple files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key principles:\n",
    "When there are patterns of repetitive code, design a function to perform that repetitive code, replacing the code by a call to the function.\n",
    "Things that vary between similar-but-not-identical code can become inputs to a function.\n",
    "Donâ€™t refer to global variables inside a function, ever.\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "With this activity you will use everything you've learned so far to turn a long and complex-seeming program into a short, elegant, efficient program. The original program is more than 300 lines of code; your final program will be fewer than 60 lines of actual code, plus a few blank lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions and do each step as you are given it. There is a reason we've chosen to have you perform the steps in the order given. Trust us!\n",
    "\n",
    "For each step of this lab, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read the step.\n",
    "- If the step asks you to discuss, reflect, or write, do so in the markdown reflection cells given.\n",
    "- If you become stuck on any step for longer than 2 minutes, ask for help!\n",
    "- Once you've completed the step, make sure all team members understand the solution and could reproduce it.\n",

Perform each step below, in order.\n",

This way, the original code will remain unchanged, and if necessary you can delete the new work and start over with the original again. We always want to keep a copy of every working version of the program, in case we modify it and can't get the new one working.\n",

Record your ideas in this markdown cell under the section called \"Code Notes\". **IMPORTANT:** In a code cell, htting escape key followed by the L key (lowercase not caps) will reveal line numbers.\n",
    "3. In the following cod cell, implement your ideas for condensing lines 28 through 50. Do not change any other part of the script (for now). Run and test the new program to ensure that it still works exactly as before. Remember that you can still run the original script above for comparison.\n",
    "4. Find all the other places in the script with code similar to lines 28 through 50. For each, replace the original code by the new loop youâ€™ve designed. **Note: the code segments are not identical: you will need to determine the differences and adjust the new loop accordingly.**   There should be a total of ten segments replaced. Make sure to **test your code after you introduce each of the ten loops** to make sure it works correctly.\n",

    "\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "In the last step, you figured out how to reduce a set of lines using a loop, and then you replaced 10 similar sections with a similar loop. Repeating a pattern 10 times is a clear sign that a function is needed. The next steps will walk you through an analysis of how the function should work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As before, save a copy of the code in the last cell into the code cell below, and make all new changes to the new script in that cell below.\n",
    "2. Each of the sequences you found in the last step is preceded by lines that move the relevant turtle to a specific location. Taken all together, these lines draw five circles evenly spaced around a center point, with a specified size. The colors of the circles are taken from the turtleâ€™s colors. Thus we will call our new function drawFiveCircles.\n",
    "3. Look at the first two occurrences of the circle-drawing sequences. Discuss as a team what parts of each section stay the same, and what parts differ. In the section below in this cell, record the parts that differ, and have instructor or preceptor check you on this.\n",
    "*Commentary: When defining a function, the parts that differ become input parameters: we use abstraction to generalize the different parts by making them something that is passed in as a value during a call to the function.*\n",
    "4. You should have found four significant differences: the turtle doing the drawing, the radius of the circles being drawn, and the center (x, y) location that the turtle moves to before drawing. Make these four values be input parameters to drawFiveCircles.\n",
    "5. Add the definition of drawFiveCircles at the top of the file, just below the import statements. Give it four inputs: turt, radius, centerX, and centerY.\n",
    "6. Copy the first occurrence of the movement code and the loop you created, and paste them as the body of your new function. Be sure they are indented properly under the function header line (the line that starts with def).\n",
    "7. Inside the body of the function, replace every reference to the drawing turtle by turt, replace the circleâ€™s radius by the input variable radius, and replace the x and y location for the goto with centerX and centerY.\n",
    "8. Add a summary, descriptive comment to describe your function. This is done by putting a triple-quoted string that starts, indented as a part of the function, right after the header line, and before any actual lines of the function body. The descriptive comment should explain what the inputs to the function are, and what the function does.\n",
    "9. Next you need to test and debug your new function.\n",
    "    a. Find the code that you copied into the function, and comment out those lines. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Add a line that calls your new function, like this: drawFiveCircles(sepalTurtle, 50, 0, 0) \n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Test your function by running the program, and keep debugging until the program works exactly as it did before.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. When the program runs correctly, then you can delete the lines you commented out.\n",
    "    \n",
    "10. Repeat this process for the lines that draw the first flowerâ€™s petals, replacing the lines with a call like this: drawFiveCircles(petalTurtle, 25, 0, 0)\n",
    "11. Do the same for each of the  4 other flowers that are drawn, testing each one before you move on to the next. In the end your program should be at least half as long as the original.\n",

If you look at the calls for different flowers, they differ only in what the center x and y location is. Now weâ€™ll make a function to draw a whole flower at once.\n",
    "1. As before, save a copy of your previous work below. Do all this work in the new file.\n",
    "2. Define a function at the top of the file called drawFlower. While it seems awkward, give it six input parameters: four different turtles, a center x value, and a center y value. This avoids referring to global variables inside your function. Be sure to include a triple-quoted descriptive comment just inside the function body.\n",
