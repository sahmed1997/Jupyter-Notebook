    "# Function Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity starts by reviewing how function calls work, and then moves on to examine simple function definitions. As you work with this activity, look at the definitions in the \"Function Call/Definition Terminology\" glossary in Moodle to help understand the terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a *procedural abstraction*. What that means is that it is a name for a set of instructions, and it is more abstract than a script because it takes a set of pre-specified inputs, rather than having all the data it works on defined before the program is run. Functions we define, like the scripts we have been writing before this, are a way of describing an algorithm to the computer. A function has the benefit of doing all its work in its own \"space,\" which is separate from the main, global space. In its space it keeps its own variables. While it is possible to refer to global variables from inside a function, the function’s own variables exist only inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions and methods are very similar, and they are called in a very similar way. A method differs from a function because it is attached to a data *object* and has access to any data associated with its object. For instance, turtle methods have access to the location of the turtle, its heading, its shape, its speed, and whether or not its pen is down, so that they can determine the effect of their actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function calls\n",
    "\n",
    "All function calls look the same: first the name of the function, then an open parenthesis (, then any input values for the function, and then a close parenthesis ). The function performs its task, and sometimes returns a value. Here are some function calls to built-in functions we have tried already. Note that the first function call does not return a result. Neither does the second function call, which is actually a call to a turtle method. The 3rd and 4th do return values. The return value replaces the function call in the larger expression or statement.\n",

    "    print('hi there')\n",
    "    fred.forward(100)\n",
    "    weirdAnswer = max(35, 102, 91, 16) + max(-2, -9, 20, 5)\n",
    "    size = len([1, 5, 2, 6, 7, 2, 8])\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function definition creates the function object and stores it in the global environment. It does not cause the steps inside the function to run, that only happens afterwards, when the function is actually called. A function definition needs to specify (1) the name of the function, (2) the inputs to the function, and (3) what should happen when the function is called (including what value should be returned, if any). Below is an outline of what a function definition looks like (it’s not a real function):\n",

    "    def functionName(var1, var2, …):\n",
    "        function body, indented statements that say what to do when function is called\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s going on with functions\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "To understand how functions work, we will start by tracing by hand what happens when a call is made to a function we have defined. This section will ask you to do that, but also to try some tools within Python and Wing and elsewhere that can help you to see what is happening.\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "### Tracing functions by hand\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "Consider the following function, which takes in three numbers and returns the smallest difference between the three numbers. Copy this function to a Python file in Wing.\n"
