    "### while Loops\n",

    "A while loop starts with a Boolean test expression, and then has a block of indented Python statements in its body. As long as the test expression evaluates to True, the program keeps repeating the statements in the loop body, and then re-checking the test expression. It stops only when the test evaluates to False.\n",

    "In a for loop the loop variable is very obvious; it is declared as a part of the main line of the loop. The while loop also must have a loop variable, but sometimes it is harder to figure out. It actually follows the accumulator patterns, very often.\n",

    "There are typically at least three statements involved in the loop that related to the loop variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A statement assigning the loop variable to an initial value before the loop\n",
    "- The boolean expression that controls the loop, comparing the loop variable to something\n",
    "- A statement inside the loop that modifies the value of the loop variable\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the loop variable is count. It is initialized to 1 in the first line, it is compared to total in the boolean test of the while loop, and it is incremented in the\n",
