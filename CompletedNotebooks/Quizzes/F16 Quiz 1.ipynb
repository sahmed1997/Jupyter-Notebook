    "## Problem 1\n",
    "Write a function called **wordOrdinal** that takes one parameter: an integer number between 0 and 12, including 12. This function will return a string that represents the English ordinal word value of the number. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    wordOrdinal(0) should return 'zeroth'\n",
    "    wordOrdinal(1) should return 'first'\n",
    "    wordordinal(2) should return 'second'\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    wordOrdinal(12) should return 'twelfth'\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next, include in a function called test** a series of tests where you try each value valid value in the **wordOrdinal** function and print out the return value (use a for loop for this, going through 0 through 12). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Next, write a brief function named main()** that will take an input integer from the user by asking them to enter any number from 0 through 12. Using what the user entered, print out its textual ordinal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next, add functionality to main()** such that you continually ask the user for a number unless they enter -1, in which case you would stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main section of the code is provided for you below. You write the two functions.\n",

    "- There is an initial fixed fee from point of departure of $\\unicode{0x20AC}$3.00 \n",

    "\n",
    "## To Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the calcRomeFare() function, which will take in the number of kilometers and return a fare in euros ($\\unicode{0x20AC}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a main() function that will take the user input in kilometers and print out the fare.\n",
